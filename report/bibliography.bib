	abstract={Segments extracted from financial time series are widely used in trend analysis as well as in predicting future tendency of the price movement. Recent approaches for time series segmentation often rely on an arbitrary threshold value and segments are generated at only one level. In this paper, we propose a novel time series segmentation method based on Turning Points which are extracted from the maximum or minimum points of the time series. The proposed segmentation method generates segments at different levels of details and achieves satisfactory results in preserving higher number of trends compared to an existing segmentation approach.},

abstract = "One of the major duties of financial analysts is technical analysis. It is necessary to locate the technical patterns in the stock price movement charts to analyze the market behavior. Indeed, there are two main problems: how to define those preferred patterns (technical patterns) for query and how to match the defined pattern templates in different resolutions. As we can see, defining the similarity between time series (or time series subsequences) is of fundamental importance. By identifying the perceptually important points (PIPs) directly from the time domain, time series and templates of different lengths can be compared. Three ways of distance measure, including Euclidean distance (PIP-ED), perpendicular distance (PIP-PD) and vertical distance (PIP-VD), for \{PIP\} identification are compared in this paper. After the \{PIP\} identification process, both template- and rule-based pattern-matching approaches are introduced. The proposed methods are distinctive in their intuitiveness, making them particularly user friendly to ordinary data analysts like stock market investors. As demonstrated by the experiments, the template- and the rule-based time series matching and subsequence searching approaches provide different directions to achieve the goal of pattern identification.

Time series data is characterized as large in data size, high dimensionality and update continuously. Moreover, the time series data is always considered as a whole instead of individual numerical fields. Indeed, a large set of time series data is from stock market. Stock time series has its own characteristics over other time series. Moreover, dimensionality reduction is an essential step before many time series analysis and mining tasks. For these reasons, research is prompted to augment existing technologies and build new representation to manage financial time series data. In this paper, financial time series is represented according to the importance of the data points. With the concept of data point importance, a tree data structure, which supports incremental updating, is proposed to represent the time series and an access method for retrieving the time series data point from the tree, which is according to their order of importance, is introduced. This technique is capable to present the time series in different levels of detail and facilitate multi-resolution dimensionality reduction of the time series data. In this paper, different data point importance evaluation methods, a new updating method and two dimensionality reduction approaches are proposed and evaluated by a series of experiments. Finally, the application of the proposed representation on mobile environment is demonstrated. "

abstract={Financial time series often exhibit high degrees of fluctuation which are considered as noise in time series analysis. To remove noise, several lower bounding the Euclidean distance based dimensionality reduction methods are applied. But, however, these methods do not meet the constraint of financial time series analysis that wants to retain the important points and remove others. Therefore, although a number of methods can retain the important points in the financial time series reduction, but, however, they loss the nature of financial time series which consist of several uptrends, downtrends and sideway trends in different resolutions and in the zigzag directions. In this paper, we propose the zigzag based perceptually important point identification method to collect those zigzag movement important points. Further, we propose zigzag based multiway search tree to index these important points. We evaluate our methods in time series dimensionality reduction. The results show the significant performance comparing to other original method.},

A time series is a collection of observations made chronologically. The nature of time series data includes: large in data size, high dimensionality and necessary to update continuously. Moreover time series data, which is characterized by its numerical and continuous nature, is always considered as a whole instead of individual numerical field. The increasing use of time series data has initiated a great deal of research and development attempts in the field of data mining. The abundant research on time series data mining in the last decade could hamper the entry of interested researchers, due to its complexity. In this paper, a comprehensive revision on the existing time series data mining research is given. They are generally categorized into representation and indexing, similarity measure, segmentation, visualization and mining. Moreover state-of-the-art research issues are also highlighted. The primary objective of this paper is to serve as a glossary for interested researchers to have an overall picture on the current time series data mining development and identify their potential research direction to further investigation.

abstract = "Time series visualization is a fundamental task in most financial applications. A framework that can reduce the dimensionality of the time series data, sufficiently accurate so that it can capture the actual shape of the time series but, at the same time, salient points will not be smoothed out can take advantage of charting the raw time series data. On the other hand, it is preferable that the representation framework can handle the multi-resolution problem rather than reduce the dimension to a fixed level only. In this paper, a framework that represents and visualizes time series data based on data point importance is proposed. Furthermore, discovering frequently appearing and surprising patterns are non-trivial tasks in financial applications. A method for discovering patterns across different resolutions is proposed. The proposed method is based on a modified version of VizTree. By converting the time series to symbol string based on data point importance, the potential patterns with different lengths can be encoded in the VizTree for visual pattern discovery while the important points and the overall shape of the time series patterns can be preserved even under a high compression ratio. Various experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. One may find it particularly attractive in financial applications like stock data analysis. "
